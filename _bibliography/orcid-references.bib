Time-bounded events such as hackathons can provide an opportunity for newcomers to experience programming firsthand in a collaborative environment. Just providing access to computational resources, however, is not sufficient because newcomers will likely require guidance and support in order for them to perceive their participation in a hackathon as a positive experience propelling them to future success in the subject. We have developed a hackathon format for this purpose that we have successfully applied during in-person events for two years. The global pandemic of 2020, however, forced us to move towards a virtual format. In this paper, we report on our experience making this transition. We will specifically elaborate on two online events, discuss successes and failures and provide suggestions for hackathon organizers.},booktitle={Sixth Annual International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons, and Game Creation Events},pages={78–82},numpages={5},keywords={online hackathon, community engagement, time-bounded collaborative event, learning},location={Montreal, Canada},series={ICGJ 2021}}
