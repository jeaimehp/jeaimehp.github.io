    The Charles Creek area in Elizabeth City, NC experiences frequent flood
    conditions seemingly unrelated to rainfall amounts. The purpose of this
    study was to compare barometric pressures, lunar cycles, wind directions,
    and wind speeds with water depth readings of Charles Creek (a tributary of
    the Pasquotank River). A static remote imaging system was used to measure
    water depth through pixel enumeration and referencing through remote sensing
    techniques coupled with custom image processing software. Environmental data
    was collected through Elizabeth City State University's National Renewable
    Energy Laboratory Weather Monitoring Station. The data was correlated using
    MINITAB (R) to find an equation to approximate a model of the rise of the
    Creek water level based upon environmental conditions. The regression
    equation had a coefficient of determination of 42%; this means there was a
    42% probability the model was useful at predicting the pixel count based on
    environmental variables.

    Mashups are an exciting genre of interactive Web applications that draw upon
    content retrieved from external data sources to create entirely new and
    innovative services. The purpose of the Mobile Applications Research Team
    was to create an interface mashup in which geographic information and meta
    data from buildings located on the campus of Elizabeth City State University
    (ECSU) can be presented to users via mobile platforms. The project includes
    HTML5 programming which referenced a database that housed information such
    as location, building establishment date, academic departments, and academic
    programs. The information was then compiled using a PHP Hypertext Processor
    (PHP) form to populate a MySQL database. HTML5 coupled with PHP programming
    was then used to render a mobile web page with both map and database
    information.

    Using Google Map Maker paths, streets, and buildings were created in
    appropriate geographic locations on the ECSU campus. The Google Maps
    Application Programming Interface was then used to generate Uniform Resource
    Locator's to both retrieve user Global Positioning System coordinates and
    create walking directions to selected locations. The user then had the
    ability to generate walking directions to locations on the university's
    campus.

    The explosion of IoT devices and sensors in recent years has led to a demand
    for efficiently storing, processing and analyzing time-series data.
    Geoscience researchers use time-series data stores such as Hydroserver,
    VOEIS and CHORDS. Many of these tools require a great deal of infrastructure
    to deploy and expertise to manage and scale. Tapis's (formerly known as
    Agave) platform as a service provides a way to support researchers in a way
    that they are not responsible for the infrastructure and can focus on the
    science. The University of Hawaii (UH) and Texas Advanced Computing Center
    (TACC) have collaborated to develop a new API integration that combines
    Tapis with the CHORDS time series data service to support projects at both
    institutions for storing, annotating and querying time-series data. This new
    Streams API leverages the strengths of both the Tapis platform and CHORDS
    service to enable capabilities for supporting time-series data streams not
    available in either tool alone. These new capabilities may be leveraged by
    Tapis powered science gateways with needs for handling spatially indexed
    time-series data-sets for their researchers as they have been at UH and
    TACC.

    Interaction is the key to making education more engaging. Effective
    interaction is difficult enough to achieve in a live classroom, and it is
    extremely challenging in a virtual environment. To keep the degree of
    instruction and learning at the levels our students have come to expect,
    additional efforts are required to focus efforts on other facets to motivate
    learning, whether the learning is relative to students in our academic
    courses, student internship programs, Summer Institute Series, or NSF/TACC's
    Frontera Fellowship Program. We focus our efforts in lecturing less and
    interacting more.

    The University of Indiana and Elizabeth City State University are working
    with the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) to develop and
    deploy cyberinfrastructure grid computing resources and synthetic aperture
    radar (SAR) data storage capabilities for Greenland and Antarctic fieldwork.
    This paper will detail the Summer 2008 efforts of the Polar Grid team to
    configure and establish field and base camp servers. The base camp system
    consists of one eight-core server, three raid arrays with 34 terabytes (TB)
    of total storage in a RAID 10 configuration (13 TB useable), a custom
    designed compact peripheral control interface (CPCI) system, and 80 TB of
    external storage in the form of 40 two TB MyBook external hard drives. The
    field camp system also consisted of one eight-core server, but did not
    contain the raid arrays. Multiple SATA hard drives were used to store the
    data.

    Continuing the commitment of the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society
    (GRSS) to education and outreach, the IEEE 2009 International Geoscience and
    Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) conference in Cape Town, South Africa
    provided an opportunity for over 400 local high school students to engage in
    hand-son GPS training and remote sensing workshops. Mafeteng Schools
    Environment Network (MSEN) and the Students' Health and Welfare Centres
    Organization (SHAWCO) worked with the University of Cape Town (UCT) in
    identifying student learners from socioeconomically challenged populations
    in metropolitan Cape Town. Activities included a remote sensing art
    workshop, Mathematics of Remote Sensing team contest, and a scavenger hunt.
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists led
    discussions and demonstrations of educational products to help build
    understanding of the science of Earth's systems and the stewardship of our
    planet, and to foster avenues to explore careers in science. This paper
    details the education outreach events and gives demographic information on
    the participants.

    Through improvements in technology, high resolution multi-spectral imaging
    allowed new capabilities to become available in the remote sensing field.
    Spectral signature classification technologies existed in the chemical
    spectroscopy field to identify minerals by way of active systems [1]. The
    theory of this paper surrounded the premise that passive systems can provide
    spectral signatures of objects within images from satellite platforms.
    Specifically this paper targeted land cover types from the Kittyhawk, North
    Carolina area. Multi-spectral signals presented up to seven individual
    readings per pixel. As the decision support system, a neural network was
    trained to decide the type of land cover based on the band readings. In an
    effort to determine specific land cover types based on need, ground truthed
    spectral readings were also classified using a linear model to convert the
    readings into approximate satellite readings. The converted readings were
    then classified by the trained neural network. A minimal r-squared valued of
    86% was required to be considered a viable method of image classification.

    Elizabeth City State University currently operates a TeraScan Grounding
    station capable of receiving and processing imagery data collected by
    satellites managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA). The imagery received in the Infrared spectrum both measures sea
    surface temperatures and cloud cover for the eastern coast of North
    Carolina. Once the data sets were collected, they were statistically
    analyzed using the analysis of variance methodology and regression. Strong
    correlations were observed during the AVHRR-Buoy comparison for two of the
    three areas under the study. The NOAA-16 AVHRR SST emerged as the most
    consistent with the insitu data from the ORIN7 Buoy. This was due to its
    high coefficient of determination.

    The fields of meteorology, surface- and groundwater hydrology, and forestry
    are often decoupled despite the fact that they occur simultaneously at the
    intersection of living systems and the physical environment. In this work,
    we describe a system that allows concurrent measurement of canopy
    throughfall, transpiration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity at
    multiple heights, in addition to soil moisture and several surface water
    parameters. LEAF is designed to be generalizable to many other hydrology and
    meteorology applications, and is modular such that it is easily adaptable
    for use with additional, diverse environmental monitoring sensors. This
    low-cost, light-weight, solar-powered system is capable of simultaneous
    streaming telemetry as well as local data logging via SD card.

    Agencies such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
    Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), and the National
    Geographic Society, to name a few, collect Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) imagery data through small surveys which are often used to generate
    digital elevation models (DEMs). Surface water simulations and hazard
    planning simulations often use these DEM data sets for localized
    calculations. The data sets area at times in data silos, creating
    bottlenecks modelers must overcome when creating needed applications.
    Moreover, the imagery data sets are not standardized, meaning they have
    different coordinate reference systems, they are of different spatial sizes,
    they are of different resolutions, and they are of different geographic
    locations. To ease usability a database was needed which included the
    metadata for the different types of LIDAR imagery files. This database
    system would include the following information: where the file was located
    in the file system, what the file included, what coordinate reference system
    was utilized, and what geographic location was associated with the file. The
    research explains a method as to how this task was accomplished using the
    Texas Advanced Computing Center's Stampede2 supercomputer and associated
    storage systems.

    This paper shares the results of a survey conducted October-November 2022.
    The survey’s intent was to learn how the community both shares and discovers
    training and education materials, whether those needs were being met, and if
    there were interest in improving how materials are shared. The survey
    resulted in 112 responses primarily from content authors who are, or
    support, academics. While the majority of respondents considered themselves
    successful in finding materials, most also encountered barriers, such as
    finding materials, but not at the needed depth or level. Most respondents
    were both interested in, and able to, work toward community efforts to
    improve finding materials, with most citing lack of staff time as a barrier
    to doing so. Proposed efforts in community engagement to work toward these
    efforts are discussed.

    Developing a workforce with applied skills in the high-performance computing
    (HPC) field has highlighted a gap in personnel experiences needed for
    capabilities towards scientific purposes. The exposure provided in current
    academic programs, especially on an entry level is insufficient. To increase
    student participation HackHPC, a collaboration between the Science Gateways
    Community Institute, Omnibond Systems, the Texas Advanced Computing Center,
    and the University of Tartu was formed to address that gap through the
    application of events known as hackthons. Hackathons are time-bounded events
    during which participants form teams to work on a project that is of
    interest to them. Hosting a hackathon that has the desired long term
    outcomes involves a number of crucial decisions related<br> to preparing,
    running and following up on an event. In this paper, we report on the
    development and refinement of the ”HackHPC Model” which includes
    methodologies, participants, procedures, and refined implementation of
    practices used to plan and host hackathon events to foster workforce
    development in HPC.

    In response to problems surrounding measuring ice sheet thickness in high
    attenuation areas of Greenland and the Antarctic, the Center for the Remote
    Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) created a Multi-Channel RADAR Depth Sounder
    (MCRDS). The MCRDS system was used to measure ice thicknesses of up to five
    kilometers in depth. This system produced large datasets, which required
    greater processing capabilities in the field. The purpose of this project
    was to test processing performance on a 32-core cluster through distributed
    computing resources. Testing involved a six-node cluster with an attached
    storage array and use of the CReSIS Synthetic Aperture RADAR Processor
    (CSARP) through the MATLAB Distributed Server Job Manager. Performance
    testing was derived from average run times collected once CSARP jobs
    completed. The run times were then compared using an ANOVA test with a five
    percent significance level.

    Acquiring computing skills is essential not only to work in computer science
    but also because many impactful discoveries occur at the interface between
    traditional scientific disciplines and computing and data science.
    Time-bounded events such as hackathons can provide an opportunity for
    newcomers to experience programming firsthand in a collaborative
    environment. Just providing access to computational resources, however, is
    not sufficient because newcomers will likely require guidance and support in
    order for them to perceive their participation in a hackathon as a positive
    experience propelling them to future success in the subject. We have
    developed a hackathon format for this purpose that we have successfully
    applied during in-person events for two years. The global pandemic of 2020,
    however, forced us to move towards a virtual format. In this paper, we
    report on our experience making this transition. We will specifically
    elaborate on two online events, discuss successes and failures and provide
    suggestions for hackathon organizers.

    (ECSU) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in February of 2012. The
    MOU stated that ECSU would provide a training site for SeaSpace’s technology
    and data products along with integration of the products into classroom
    curriculum. In return, SeaSpace would provide ground stations for receiving
    direct broadcast data from various telemetries. The ground stations include
    a 3.7 m X/L band, 3.6 m C band, and a 5.0 m L band dish, along with
    accompanying computing hardware. The purpose of this project was to generate
    a training curriculum focused on the K-12 classroom, along with college
    courses, and outside governmental agencies. The curriculum contains 15
    modules, which as a whole could be presented as a 10-hour course that
    qualifies as one continuing education unit (CEU) for K-12 teachers and
    administrators. Example modules for “Introduction to Remote Sensing” and
    “Introduction to TeraScan” were also created as models for further
    components.
