  <h2>Greetings, I’m Je’aime Powell</h2>

  <p>
    I work at the intersection of <strong>high-performance computing, AI, and workforce development</strong>,
    helping people make sense of—and actually use—advanced computing systems. My passion is building technology
    and communities that lower barriers to research computing, so students, faculty, and researchers can focus
    on discovery instead of infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m a Product &amp; Systems Analyst at <strong><a href="https://omnibond.com" target="_blank">Omnibond Systems</a></strong>, where I help design and deploy
    <strong><a href="https://projecteureka.ai" target="_blank">projectEUREKA!</a></strong>, a hybrid-cloud research platform that brings HPC, AI, Kubernetes, and
    science-gateway workflows together in a way that’s practical and approachable. I spend a lot of my time
    hands-on: building clusters, integrating tools, testing real workloads, and thinking deeply about how people
    experience research infrastructure—not just how it works on paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Equally important to me is the human side of technology. I’m actively involved in
    <strong>workforce development and community-driven training</strong>, working with programs like
    <strong><a href="https://sciencegateways.org" target="_blank">SGX3</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://hackhpc.github.io" target="_blank">HackHPC</a></strong>, and faculty hackathons to help students and educators gain
    real, transferable skills. I believe the best way to learn advanced computing is by doing—through hackathons,
    demos, and working systems that reflect how research actually happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll often find me contributing to and learning from communities around <strong>Supercomputing/AI</strong>,
    <strong>Science Gateways</strong>, <strong>Workforce Development</strong>, and <strong>CyberTraining</strong>, where I advocate for inclusive
    access to cyberinfrastructure, sustainable research software, and training pathways that connect education to
    real-world impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the core of everything I do is a simple belief:<br />
    <blockquote><strong>"Advanced computing should feel Empowering, Not Overwhelming."</strong></blockquote>
