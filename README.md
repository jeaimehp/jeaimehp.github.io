# Hi, I’m Je’aime Powell 👋

I’m a technologist, researcher, and community builder working at the intersection of **high-performance computing (HPC)**, **artificial intelligence**, and **workforce development**. My work focuses on making advanced computing systems more accessible, usable, and meaningful for researchers, educators, and students.

Professionally, I work as a Product & Systems Analyst at Omnibond Systems, where I help design, deploy, and evolve **projectEUREKA!**—a hybrid-cloud research platform that brings together HPC, AI workflows, Kubernetes, and science-gateway technologies. I’m deeply hands-on, spending time building clusters, integrating infrastructure, testing real workloads, and thinking about how people actually interact with research computing systems.

Equally important to me is the human side of technology. I’m actively involved in **workforce development and community-driven training**, supporting programs like SGX3, HackHPC, and faculty-focused hackathons. I believe the most effective way to learn advanced computing is by doing—through real systems, collaborative problem-solving, and practical experimentation rather than theory alone.

I regularly engage with research and cyberinfrastructure communities around Supercomputing (SC), Gateways, ADMI, and US-RSE, where I advocate for inclusive access to computing resources, sustainable research software practices, and training pathways that connect education to real-world impact.

This portfolio is a collection of projects, experiments, and writing that reflect how I think and work—from infrastructure and automation to education, outreach, and applied research.

At the core of everything I do is a simple belief:

> **Advanced computing should empower people, not intimidate them.**
